The Adafruit NEO Pixel Library is required in order for the code to work.  Download the library here:

Thank you to Adafruit for their tutorials... as much of the code I have provided is based on code that they provide.  Obviously the code has been modified to support my project... but all kudos go to Lady Ada and adafruit.com.

The NEOPixel Ring that is used in this project is from Adafruit at:  http://www.adafruit.com/products/1586

This ring fits in a 52mm to 67mm filter adapter (which I found on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00443EN2U) which fits my macro lens perfectly on my Canon DSLR - or 58mm to 67mm if you want to attach it to a larger lens (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083WYAIA).  I plan on designing a 3D printed hot shoe design and putting it up on Thingiverse.com within the next few weeks.  The circuit can be fouud on www.123dcircuits.com... but is a work in progress.  I will post up the final circuit design, BOM and code once I know it can be replicated easily (actually, the code here is pretty much final... it's the BOM and board design that will change).

Cheers!
